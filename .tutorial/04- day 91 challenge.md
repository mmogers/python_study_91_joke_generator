# ðŸ‘‰ Day 91 Challenge

Today's challenge is to build a program from this basic principle that will:

1. Give you a random joke.
2. Ask if you want to save it.
3. If you do, it should:
    1. Save the joke ID number to a replit db
4. Ask the user if they want to see the saved jokes and output the contents of the database.
    
Example:
